# GitHubSearch-Angular
A github search app written in Angular 1.5.5 that searches public repos by name.
This does NOT search your local or installed repos.
This app used the Github API and this search URL format: https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=repo:username/reponame


Using npm to install dev dependencies/support for Typescript 3. 
Steps to repro my setup:
1. In your command prompt (after cloning this repo): 
  $ npm init to create package.json
2. $ npm install 
3. $ npm start
